        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A cookie is a baked or cooked snack or dessert that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc. </p>
        <p>Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft, but some kinds of cookies are not baked at all. Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an array of ingredients including sugars, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried fruits. The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked. </p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong> (for 12 cookies)</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>100g sugar</li>
            <li>165g brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>115g unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>155g flour</li>
            <li>Half teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>110g milk chocolate chunks</li>
            <li>110g dark chocolate chunks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
            <li>Cool the cookies completely before serving.</li>
        </ol>
