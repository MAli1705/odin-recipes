    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An omelette (also spelled omelet) is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan (without stirring as in scrambled egg).</p>
    <p>It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), cheese, or some combination of the above. Whole eggs or egg whites are often beaten with a small amount of milk, cream, or water.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Three eggs</li>
        <li>One tablespoon almond oil</li>
        <li>One tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil and butter over a medium-low heat until the butter is foaming.</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs and tilt the pan so that the eggs cover all the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook for twenty seconds then scrape a line through the middle with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny egg. Repeat once or twice more until the egg has just set.</li>
        <li>Fill the omelette with whatever you like, some grated cheese, sliced ham, fresh herbs, saut√©ed mushrooms or smoked salmon.</li>
        <li>Scatter the filling over the top of the omelette and fold gently in half with the spatula. Slide onto a plate to serve.</li>
    </ol>
